    <h3>Who is Demon1?</h3>
    <p>Max “Demon1” Mazanov is one of <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/">VALORANT</a>'s rising stars in the <a href="https://liquipedia.net/valorant/VCT/2023">VCT 2023</a> season. After starting the 2023 season as a substitute for <a href="https://liquipedia.net/valorant/Evil_Geniuses">Evil Geniuses</a>, the talented duelist quickly made his way into the starting lineup in the VCT Americas League leading the team to one of the most unlikely arcs in competitive VALORANT. By the end of week four of the VCT Americas League, Evil Geniuses stood at a 1-3 record, but by the end of the regular season they found themselves as the sixth and final seed going into the playoffs.</p>
    <h3>From Rags To Riches :-</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/maximilianmazanov/">Demon1</a> came into Valorant Champions 2023 with something to prove. The 20-year-old player didn't have the best international debut at <a href="https://liquipedia.net/valorant/VCT/2023/Masters">VCT Masters Tokyo</a>, but had a chance to prove his doubters wrong in <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=los+angeles+maps&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&ghc=1&lq=0&pq=los+angeles+map&sc=11-15&sk=&cvid=C3E81ADA54FE468DA3C6509428136316&ghsh=0&ghacc=0&ghpl=">Los Angeles</a>.
        The Evil Geniuses player made the most of his second international showing and put up some insane numbers. Demon1 seemed to embrace the community's branding of EG as the villains of the tournament on account of their habit of showboating before and after matches.</p>
    <h3>Demon1 lets the world know who he is :-</h3>
    <p>In the Grand Final match against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Rex">Paper Rex</a>, Demon1 continued his incredible form and put in another mechanical master class. From dodging <a href="https://liquipedia.net/valorant/Raze">Raze</a> ults to hitting pixel-perfect heat shots, there was no stopping the EG sniper.He finished with the top Average Combat Score in the server at 230 and the best headshot percentage at 41%.

        After the series was over, and EG had lifted the trophy, Demon1 was asked what fueled his unreal performance at the tournament. He let the crowd, and the rest of the world, know.</p>
